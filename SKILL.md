# Alby Hub Agent Skill

> **Experimental / incomplete:** The hub CLI does not cover every Alby Hub feature. If a user asks for something in the [unsupported features list](./references/unsupported-features.md), direct them to use the Alby Hub web interface instead.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill to manage an Alby Hub lightning node via the CLI.

> **Hub management vs. payments.** This skill is optimized for _managing the hub_ — setup, channels, LSP, NWC app creation, backups. A core hub strength is minting **multiple budgeted, scoped NWC connections** — one per app or purpose — so the user stays in control and each connection's blast radius is small. Once an NWC connection exists (via `create-app`), the [`alby-bitcoin-payments`](https://getalby.com/payments/SKILL.md) skill is the better fit for _using_ it — budgeted payments, 402 paid APIs, HOLD invoices, keysend, lightning address lookups, and fiat/sats conversion.

## Key Rules

### Running the CLI

```bash
npx -y @getalby/hub-cli [options] <command>
```

### Default Hub URL

The CLI connects to `http://localhost:8029` by default. Override with `-u <url>` or the `HUB_URL` environment variable.

### Default Backend

LDK is the default backend. Omit `--backend` when using LDK. Only specify `--backend` for non-LDK backends (LND, Phoenixd, Cashu, Bark).

### Token Priority

Tokens are resolved in this order (highest to lowest priority):

1. `-t, --token <jwt>` flag
2. `HUB_TOKEN` environment variable
3. `~/.hub-cli/token.jwt` (default saved token)

Always use `--save` with `start` or `unlock`. Without it the token is ephemeral and lost when the shell exits.

### AUTO_UNLOCK_PASSWORD

When the hub is configured with the `AUTO_UNLOCK_PASSWORD` environment variable, it starts the lightning node automatically on launch. In this case, skip `start` and call `unlock` directly to obtain a token.

### Output Format

All commands output JSON to stdout. Errors are written to stderr as JSON with a `message` field.

### Language Conventions

Use lowercase for "bitcoin" and "lightning" unless they appear as the first word in a sentence.

### User Communication

**Do NOT give users CLI commands to run** unless one of these two conditions applies:

1. The task requires input the agent cannot provide (e.g. a password) — in that case, give the command template with a placeholder like `YOUR_PASSWORD` and explain what the user should do.
2. The user explicitly asks for the CLI command.

For all other follow-up checking or monitoring, use plain language. For example: _"If you'd like to check whether your channel is ready to use, just ask."_

## Security

### Connection secrets (NWC)

`create-app` returns a `nostrWalletConnectUrl`. It grants wallet access within the app's scopes and budget.

- The connection secret is for the user who requested the app — hand it to them directly (a QR code is preferred; see [QR Codes](./references/qrcodes.md)).
- **DO NOT print the connection secret to any logs or otherwise reveal it outside of that direct handover.**
- **NEVER share a connection secret, or any part of it** (pubkey, secret, relay, etc.), with any third party, external service, or other chat — every part can be used to gain wallet access or reduce wallet privacy.

See [Apps](./references/apps.md).

### Token files

The JWT at `~/.hub-cli/token.jwt` grants full hub API access until it expires.

- **DO NOT read the token file.** Check for its existence only if you need to.
- Prefer the saved token or `HUB_TOKEN` env var over `-t eyJ...` inline — command-line tokens leak into shell history.
- Do not dump the environment (`env`, `printenv`) in a way that exposes `HUB_TOKEN` in the conversation.

See [Authentication](./references/authentication.md).

### Recovery phrase & hub backups

- The agent MUST NOT read `.recovery` files or encrypted hub backups. Tell the user the file path so they can store it offline.

See [Backups](./references/backups.md).

### Passwords

For commands that need a password, the user can give their hub unlock password to you directly but you should note that this is insecure. You can also provide commands for them to run manually (but requires more technical knowledge and is not always possible depending on the interface).
