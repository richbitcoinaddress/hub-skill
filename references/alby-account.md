## Connecting Your Alby Account

Connecting requires two steps:

**Step 1** — Get the authorization URL:

```bash
npx -y @getalby/hub-cli@0.5.0 connect-alby-account
```

This returns a JSON object with an `albyAuthUrl`. Tell the user to open that URL in their browser, sign in to their Alby account, and copy the authorization code they receive.

**Step 2** — Submit the authorization code:

```bash
npx -y @getalby/hub-cli@0.5.0 connect-alby-account --code <code>
```

On success, returns `{ "success": true }`. If the account is already connected, step 1 returns `{ "albyAccountConnected": true, "albyUserIdentifier": "..." }` instead of a URL.
