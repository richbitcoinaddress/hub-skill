## On-Chain Reserve Warning

After running `get-balances`, check the on-chain balance. If `lightning.totalSpendable > 0` and `onchain.spendable < 20000`, warn the user in a friendly, non-scary way:

> Your on-chain balance is low. While your funds are safe in your channel, having at least ~20,000 sats on-chain provides a safety reserve in case a channel ever needs to close on-chain unexpectedly. You can top up via `get-onchain-address`.

## Notes

- `--amount` for `pay-invoice` is in millisatoshis (msat). Use for zero-amount invoices only.
- `--amount` for `make-invoice` is in millisatoshis.
- `get-balances` returns both lightning (channel) and on-chain balances.
